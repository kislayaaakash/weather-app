# CityWeatherService: Weather Advisory and Backup Management

## Overview
The WeatherApp application provides a real-time weather advisory service to users, with a robust fallback mechanism for offline or error scenarios. The service fetches data from an external API and maintains a local backup for uninterrupted service.

### Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Weather Advisory**: Fetches weather data for cities using an external API.
2. **Offline Fallback**: Uses backup data when the service is offline or the external API fails.
3. **Weather Advice Generation**: Provides actionable advice based on weather conditions.
4. **Data Backup and Maintenance**: Updates the local backup with the latest weather data to ensure availability.

### Workflow and Design:

#### Online Mode:
1. Fetches weather data from the external API.
2. If the API returns valid data:
   - Generate and return weather advice. 
   - If city weather details do not exist in the backup, update the backup with the data and append the `lastUpdated` field with the current UTC time.
   - If the city exists in the backup, generate and return weather advice. Update the backup when:
     - The difference between the current UTC time and the `lastUpdated` value is greater than 30 minutes.
     - Check if the first weather entry in the backup is different from the fetched details from the API. If so, update the backup.
     - Before updates, set the `lastUpdated` field with the current UTC time.
3. **API failure scenarios:**
   - Wrong city input: Return empty data with a corresponding message and status code.
   - Other issues: Fall back to the backup, generate weather advice, and if not found, return a 503 error with the message: "Service temporarily unavailable."

#### Offline Mode:
1. Directly retrieve weather details from the backup, generate weather advice, and return.

## How to Use:

1. **Start the Service**: Initialize the service to start fetching weather data.
2. **Handle Errors**: Ensure that fallback mechanisms are in place for API failures or offline scenarios.
3. **Backup Updates**: The service will periodically update the backup to maintain the latest data.

### Notes:
- This project follows **SOLID** principles for better maintainability and scalability.
- It is designed to be highly **scalable** by implementing asynchronous communication and efficient data fetching.
- **12-factor app** methodology is considered by ensuring:
  - Externalized configuration (API endpoints, backup paths).
  - Stateless operations where applicable.
  - Backups are kept outside of the app container (storage-based).
  - Continuous integration and monitoring through logging and error handling.
